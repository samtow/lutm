# SIM / telephony emulation for LineageOS-on-QEMU (virtio)

This directory adds a **guest-side, self-contained** modem and simulated
physical SIM to the `virtio_x86_64` / `virtio_arm64only` builds. It is intended
to expose a UICC and emulated carrier, voice, SMS and data state to Android.
It does not connect to a real cellular network or provide working carrier
IMS/RCS merely by implementing radio HAL interfaces.

Nothing is required from the host/QEMU command line and nothing is required from
UTM: the modem lives entirely inside the guest image.

## Why this shape

Android needs a `android.hardware.radio` HAL that reports a present UICC. The
device tree used here (`device/virt/virtio-common`) ships **no radio HAL at all**,
which is why the framework currently reports "no SIM".

Rather than reimplement the radio HAL, this uses the pieces AOSP already
maintains for its virtual devices, which are already synced as part of this build
tree (`device/virt/virt-common` already consumes `device/google/cuttlefish`):

| Piece | Source (in-tree) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Guest radio HAL + `reference-ril` | `device/google/cuttlefish/guest/hals/ril/{reference-libril,reference-ril}` | AIDL `android.hardware.radio.*` services; run through the vendored RIL |
| `com.google.cf.rild` APEX | `device/google/cuttlefish/apex/com.google.cf.rild` | Packages the RIL and overrides `rild`/`libril`/`libreference-ril`; provides `vendor.ril-daemon` |
| Modem/UICC simulator | `device/google/cuttlefish/host/commands/modem_simulator` | Speaks the AT protocol + emulates the SIM, network, calls, SMS, data |

In stock Cuttlefish the modem simulator runs on the **host** and the guest RIL
reaches it over **virtio-vsock** (`androidboot.modem_simulator_ports=<port>`).
For a self-contained VM we run the same simulator **inside the guest** and use
vsock **loopback** (`VMADDR_CID_LOCAL`) instead.

## What `apply.sh` does

Run `bash /path/to/lutm/sim/apply.sh /path/to/android/lineage` after `repo sync`,
before `breakfast`. This checkout does not include a top-level `build.sh`.

1. Copies this overlay into `device/virt/virtio-common`:
   - `virtio-sim.mk` / `virtio-sim-board.mk` — product + board config
   - `framework-overlay/*` — one physical SIM slot and telephony capability
     resources, ahead of the inherited LineageOS Wi-Fi-only overlay
   - `configs/init/init.virtio.sim.rc` — installed at `/vendor/etc/init/` to seed
     `/data/vendor/modem_simulator`; init does not recursively import `etc/init/hw/`
   - `configs/properties/vendor.sim.prop` — telephony properties
   - `sepolicy/vendor-sim/*` — SELinux for the simulator, plus the
     `ro.boot.modem_simulator_ports` property type the Cuttlefish RIL policy
     expects (its own copy lives in a Cuttlefish sepolicy dir the virtio board
     config does not include)
   - `modem_simulator/*` — device build of the modem simulator, plus the
     control-plane socket in `main_virtio.cpp`
   - `modem_console/*` — `modem_console`, the tool that drives the emulated
     network (see below)
2. Hooks `virtio-sim.mk` into `device-common.mk` and `virtio-sim-board.mk` into
   `BoardConfigCommon.mk`.
3. Stages the Cuttlefish simulator sources into `modem_simulator/src/`, minus the
   host-only `main.cpp` / `cf_device_config.cpp`. Soong resolves `srcs` relative
   to the `.bp`'s own directory, so they cannot be referenced in place.
4. Patches that staged copy with `sim/patch_modem_simulator.py` (21 exact-match
   edits; re-applied from pristine sources on every run):
   - deferred command handling until the SIM/network services are registered;
   - a control-plane broadcast, so a console sees the SMS the device sends and
     the delivery reports that come back;
   - SMS-DELIVER parsing in `PDUParser`, which upstream never needed because a
     Cuttlefish device only ever sends to itself. Without it a genuine
     network-delivered PDU fails validation, and the message can only be
     delivered re-encoded (`CreatePDU()`), which drops the service centre
     address and rewrites the time stamp;
   - the subscriber number API: `AT+CNUM`, `AT+REMOTEQUERYPHONENUMBER`, and a
     workable `AT+REMOTEUPADATEPHONENUMBER` (`GetNextStr(' ')` on the whole
     command string, with no `=` stripped, meant upstream's remote update could
     never have worked);
   - `AT+REMOTEOPERATOR`, to move the device to another emulated operator.
5. Rewrites the guest RIL's vsock target from `VMADDR_CID_HOST` to
   `VMADDR_CID_LOCAL` so the RIL talks to the in-guest simulator.
6. Fixes Lineage's kernel output-prefix rule for the relative `out/non-ab` and
   `out/ab` directories. Soong rejects absolute paths in some modules, while the
   kernel's `make -C` needs source-relative paths prefixed by the Android tree.

Missing device/Cuttlefish sources or an unrecognized RIL transport are errors,
not warnings followed by apparent success. `TARGET_NO_TELEPHONY=true` disables
both the product packages and the corresponding board configuration.

## Building the images

### Live build status

`sim/status` deploys to **Convex production**, with a one-minute cron job
and persistent database snapshots. Both the page and polling run in the
cloud; no managed Preview or chat turn is needed to keep them alive. Page
requests read saved status rather than starting Depot commands. Depot
credentials stay in Convex environment variables and are never sent to the browser.

The tracker shows both layouts, truthful build/check states, failures,
freshness and verified public download links. A build-only run is labeled
**built**, not uploaded or complete. Detailed logs remain private; public
activity contains numerical progress and safe failure summaries only.

See [the cloud tracker runbook](status/README.md) for launch, deployment and
local development. `npm run launch --prefix sim/status` creates a bounded
Depot builder and starts the existing dual-layout build. It requires
authorized Depot access; deploying the tracker alone does not start a build.

For a clean Ubuntu build host with the
[Android build dependencies](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/start/requirements)
installed, also install `git-lfs`, `pkg-config`, `ninja-build`, `python3-mako`,
`qemu-utils`, `bc`, `cpio`, `rsync`, `libssl-dev`, `libelf-dev` and `dwarves`. Install the
official `repo` launcher and configure Git's name/email, then run:

```shell
bash sim/build.sh "$HOME/android/lineage" virtio_x86_64
# or: bash sim/build.sh "$HOME/android/lineage" virtio_arm64only
# Optional third argument: both (default), non-ab, or ab.
```

The helper initializes LineageOS 23.2, installs `lineage-virtio.xml` as a local
manifest for the device dependencies, syncs, applies the overlay, runs the host
checks, and builds the release artifacts. `SYNC_JOBS` defaults to 8 and `BUILD_JOBS` to
the host CPU count. Set `SKIP_SYNC=1` only when resuming an already synced build.
It checks zip integrity and prints SHA-256 hashes, but does not boot the image
or upload it. These are development builds using the tree's default signing
keys, not production-signed releases.

### Upstream recovery and partition compatibility

The helper stages **both partition layouts** by default:

| Layout | Recovery | Images in addition to UTM and OTA archives |
|---|---|---|
| `non-ab` | Dedicated `recovery` partition, matching upstream | `boot_<arch>-non-ab.img`, `recovery_<arch>-non-ab.img`, `recovery_<arch>-non-ab-userdebug.img` |
| `ab` | Recovery ramdisk in `vendor_boot` | `boot_<arch>-ab.img`, `vendor_boot_<arch>-ab.img` |

The non-A/B build follows [jqssun/android-lineage-qemu's sequence](https://github.com/jqssun/android-lineage-qemu/blob/main/build.sh):
`AB_OTA_UPDATER=false`, `userdebug` standalone recovery, then the `user` UTM
bundle and OTA. The A/B build uses `AB_OTA_UPDATER=true` and `user`. The helper
checks each layout before compilation and never substitutes a standalone
recovery image for `vendor_boot`.

Build outputs are isolated in `out/non-ab` and `out/ab` (under `OUT_DIR` when
set within the Android tree). Absolute paths inside the tree are normalized to
source-relative paths for Soong. Release files are staged in
`out/releases/<product>/<layout>/` with
layout-specific filenames, a `release.json`, a pinned source manifest, and
`SHA256SUMS`. `<arch>` is `arm64only` or `x86_64`. Choose the non-A/B bundle for
upstream's `fastboot flash recovery` workflow; choose A/B for an existing A/B VM.

**The SIM archives shared on 20261004 and early 20261005 predate this correction.**
Their helper omitted the upstream override and used LineageOS's A/B default,
with recovery inside `vendor_boot` and no separate `recovery` partition. That
was unintended build drift, not a SIM requirement. The source correction does
not repartition an existing VM or replace those published archives.

A change of layout needs a fresh matching system disk. Back up the VM and
its data before replacing it; do not sideload across the two layouts or flash a
standalone recovery image to an A/B VM's `boot` or `vendor_boot` partition. On a
matching non-A/B VM, upstream's `fastboot flash recovery` workflow is supported.

To upload the produced archives separately:

```shell
bash sim/upload-gofile.sh /path/to/out/releases/virtio_arm64only/non-ab/*.zip \
    /path/to/out/releases/virtio_arm64only/non-ab/*.img
# Upload the ab/ files separately and retain their layout labels.
```

The uploader can use `GOFILE_TOKEN` and `GOFILE_FOLDER_ID`; otherwise it creates
a temporary guest account and a public folder per upload. It checks GoFile's
reported size and MD5 against each local file before printing a file page and,
when supplied by the API, its separate folder page. This is metadata verification,
not a download check. Guest files can expire after ten days of inactivity.

For manual builds, apply the overlay and preserve the same non-A/B configuration:

```shell
export AB_OTA_UPDATER=false ROOMSERVICE_BRANCHES="lineage-23.1 lineage-23.0"
breakfast virtio_x86_64 user          # or virtio_arm64only
m vm-utm-zip otapackage
```

**`m otapackage` on its own is not enough.** It produces the flashable OTA zip and
the partition images, but *not* the UTM bundle: that is a separate phony target
(`vm-utm` / `vm-utm-zip`) defined in
`device/virt/virtio-common/build/tasks/90-vm-utm.mk`. `vm-utm-zip` needs
`disk-vda.img`, which assembles the partition images into a bootable disk with an
`lpmake`-generated `super` partition, and then converts it with `qemu-img`
(install `qemu-utils`, otherwise the rule falls back to hard-linking the raw
image):

```
out/target/product/<product>/VirtualMachine/UTM/UTM-VM-<version>.zip
out/target/product/<product>/VirtualMachine/UTM/<name>.utm/config.plist
out/target/product/<product>/VirtualMachine/UTM/<name>.utm/Data/{vda.qcow2,vdb.qcow2,efi_vars.fd}
```

`vda.qcow2` is the bootable disk (5 GiB virtual); its `super` partition holds
system/vendor/product/system_ext/odm, so it is also where the emulated SIM ends
up. `vdb.qcow2` is the 16 GiB empty userdata disk.

Run `bash sim/host-quirks.sh --fix` before the first build — see the environment
section below.

## Boot flow

* `androidboot.modem_simulator_ports=9200` is added to `BOARD_BOOTCONFIG`, so the
  guest RIL reads `ro.boot.modem_simulator_ports=9200`.
* `init.virtio.sim.rc` seeds `/data/vendor/modem_simulator` during `post-fs-data`.
* The `vendor.modem-simulator` init service starts in class `core` and binds a vsock
  server on port 9200. It registers all modem services before handling commands.
  `init.virtio.sim.rc` also starts `vendor.ril-daemon` when the modem process
  reports `running`; this process state is not a socket-readiness signal.
* `vendor.ril-daemon` (via `libcuttlefish-ril-2.so`) connects to the simulator
  over vsock loopback and registers the AIDL radio HAL. If it loses the race it
  retries every 10s.
* Expected result: Android sees a SIM, a registered emulated network, and a
  simulated mobile data connection. This still needs guest-side verification.

## Verifying at runtime

```shell
adb shell 'cat /proc/bootconfig /proc/cmdline | grep modem_simulator_ports'
adb shell 'ps -A -Z | grep modem_simulator'
adb shell 'ps -A -Z | grep libcuttlefish-rild'
adb shell dumpsys telephony.registry | head
adb shell service list | grep android.hardware.radio
adb shell getprop gsm.operator.alpha                   # non-empty
```

### If the services or Android tools are missing

The bootconfig or command line must contain `modem_simulator_ports=9200`, but
that does not prove the modem binary, its init service, or the radio APEX was
installed or started. On these full-Treble images, SELinux denies `shell` reads
of `ro.boot.modem_simulator_ports` (a vendor-internal property) and the default
`init.svc.vendor.*` properties. Blank `getprop` output for those is not evidence
that the port is missing or the RIL is stopped: use `/proc/bootconfig` and `ps`
instead. A readable service state of `restarting` does confirm a failing service.

Select the intended ADB transport explicitly (replace the serial as needed):

```shell
adb -s emulator-5554 shell '
  echo "PATH=$PATH"
  for p in ro.bootmode ro.build.fingerprint sys.boot_completed init.svc.zygote \
      init.svc.modem-simulator init.svc.vendor.modem-simulator \
      init.svc.vendor.ril-daemon; do
    printf "%s=" "$p"; /system/bin/getprop "$p"
  done
  ls -l /system/bin/dumpsys /system/bin/service /system/bin/modem_console \
    /vendor/bin/hw/modem_simulator_virtio /vendor/etc/init/modem_simulator.rc \
    /vendor/etc/init/init.virtio.sim.rc \
    /apex/com.google.cf.rild/bin/hw/libcuttlefish-rild
  cat /proc/bootconfig /proc/cmdline | grep modem_simulator_ports
  ps -A -Z | grep -E "libcuttlefish-rild|modem_simulator"
'
```

Missing `dumpsys` and `service` is not a SIM-protocol failure: check for a
recovery/minimal environment, an unexpected image, or a PATH/access problem.
If the absolute paths exist, try `/system/bin/dumpsys` and `/system/bin/service`.
The `emulator-5554` serial alone does not establish which image is running.

The first 20261004 archives shared before the console socket-length fix truncate
the abstract socket name by one byte. On those images only, compensate with:

```shell
adb shell modem_console --socket modem_simulator_console_ raw 'AT+CPIN?'
```

The trailing underscore is intentional. This repairs the diagnostic connection,
not SIM detection: `+CPIN: READY` shows the simulator loaded its UICC profile,
but the radio HAL and Android subscription state still need to be checked.

If `modem-simulator` is restarting, collect init, linker and SELinux errors:

```shell
adb shell 'logcat -b all -d -t 1500 | grep -Ei "modem-simulator|modem_simulator_virtio|libcuttlefish-rild|avc: denied|Fatal signal|CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE" | tail -80'
```

The first shared archives routed simulator logs to stderr, which init discards
for this service. The source now uses Android's default logd logger so socket
and profile errors appear in logcat. This observability fix does not establish
the cause of a crash in an older image, or prove that SIM detection works.

Runtime testing of the first x86_64 archive reproduced the modem restart loop:
SELinux denied `listen` on its VSOCK socket. Adding only `listen` and `accept`
to the test copy's policy got the modem past that loop with enforcement retained.
The same run exposed a rejected vendor-init trigger for the unexported
`init.svc.modem-simulator` property and permission failures seeding `/data/misc`.
The source now names the service `vendor.modem-simulator` and keeps its state
under `/data/vendor/modem_simulator` with a vendor data type.

Once the modem was running, the inherited Wi-Fi-only overlay still declared
zero physical SIM slots. `UiccController` then crashed when the modem reported
slot 0. The SIM-specific framework overlay now declares one slot and enables
the voice, SMS and mobile-data capability flags. Its product-overlay path is
prepended so the Wi-Fi-only values cannot override it.

On a disposable x86_64 copy of the shared archive, the socket-policy repair
and these resource overrides were boot-tested with SELinux enforcing:
`AT+CPIN?` returned `READY`, `gsm.sim.state` reached `LOADED`, an active
subscription appeared, and the phone service stopped crash-looping. This test
also passed on fresh userdata: Language → Next advanced to Date & time without
the missing-SIM page. It does not verify a rebuilt ARM64 image or the source's
service/data-path changes together; the originally shared archives predate
these repairs.

If only the SIM components are missing, check `get_build_var TARGET_NO_TELEPHONY`
and `get_build_var PRODUCT_PACKAGES` in the build tree, then rebuild
`m vm-utm-zip otapackage` and boot the newly generated bundle/disk. Building an
individual module does not update an already imported UTM VM. If the files are
present but services fail, inspect init/RIL logs and SELinux denials before
changing policy. The SIM can fall back to its vendor profile even if the data
copy is absent, so the former init-path bug alone does not explain every
"no SIM" report.

## Driving the emulated network: `modem_console`

On stock Cuttlefish the simulator is driven over the **host** control plane: the
launcher connects to a monitor socket, sends `REM0` to be registered as a
"remote" client and then writes `AT+REMOTE*` commands. On a standalone device
there is no host, so `main_virtio.cpp` serves that same role itself: it listens
on an **abstract local socket** (`modem_simulator_console`) and registers every
connection as a remote client. `modem_console` is the client.

```
adb shell modem_console
```

```

```

`--json` makes any of it scriptable; `sms build` prints a PDU without a device
and `sms decode <hex>` decodes one, which is handy when checking a capture.

What "looks real" means here, concretely — every injected message is a genuine
transport PDU, not a re-encoded one:

* **GSM 03.38 default alphabet** with the escape table (`{}[]|^~\\€` cost two
  septets and must be packed that way); automatic fallback to **UCS2** for text
  the alphabet cannot carry, exactly as a handset decides.
* **SMSC address** always present, semi-octet BCD with TON/NPI, resolved from the
  SIM's own `AT+CSCA?` unless told otherwise.
* **Service centre time stamp** with the local time zone and its sign (`--age 30`
  backdates it, `--scts <epoch>` sets it). This is what the framework shows as
  the message time, which is why the PDU is delivered byte for byte.
* **UDH**: concatenation (8- and 16-bit references) and application ports, so
  multipart SMS and binary WAP-push/OTA payloads arrive as such.
* **Alphanumeric senders**, message classes, `--pid`, explicit `--dcs`.
* **Delivery reports**: ask for one with the device (`--sri` on the submit is the
  device's side) and the simulator sends the `+CDS` status report itself; the
  console reports it in `sms watch`.

Transport notes: the socket is abstract, so no `/dev/socket` entry or file label
is involved. `shell` (and `su`) may attach; the platform neverallow that forbids
coredomain→vendor socket communication is waived for this one pair via
`socket_between_core_and_vendor_violators`, with the `allow` rules still limiting
access to a shell. If you would rather not run the console on the device at all,
the same protocol is reachable through adbd without any exemption:

```shell
adb forward tcp:5000 localabstract:modem_simulator_console
# then write "REM0\r" followed by AT+REMOTE* commands to localhost:5000
```

## Which half of the RIL talks to the simulator

The APEX binary `libcuttlefish-rild` is only the shim: it reads
`ro.boot.modem_simulator_ports` and, if empty, deliberately comes up as
\"no-ril\". The AT/vsock transport lives in `libcuttlefish-ril-2.so`
(`guest/hals/ril/reference-ril/reference-ril.c`). Its SELinux domain is
`libcuttlefish_rild` (not `rild`), and that domain may only use vsock because
Cuttlefish adds it to `unconstrained_vsock_violators`; the simulator needs the
same exemption, which is why `modem_simulator.te` mirrors it under
`starting_at_board_api(202504, ...)`.

## Verification status

Current host checks: thirteen boot-wiring/application regressions, ten offline
release-build regressions, nine offline
upload regressions, 60 PDU checks, and a real-socket console regression covering
the default, custom and maximum-length abstract socket names
pass via `bash sim/run-host-tests.sh`, using the bundled reference when no tree
is supplied. Pass a synced tree explicitly to also check patch compatibility
against its pristine Cuttlefish sources. These tests do not boot Android or
compile the full device modem/radio stack.

The original snapshot records the following build-only results against a synced
LineageOS 23.2 tree. They have **not** been re-run for the startup fixes above;
the image contents below describe that older baseline, including the unimported
`/vendor/etc/init/hw/init.virtio.sim.rc`. The fixed path requires a rebuilt image.

| Check | Target | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Simulator compiles and links for device | `m modem_simulator_virtio` | pass (installs `/vendor/bin/hw/modem_simulator_virtio`) |
| Console compiles and links for device | `m modem_console` | pass (installs `/system/bin/modem_console`, no shared library dependencies) |
| PDU codec behaviour | `sim/run-host-tests.sh` | pass (60 checks) |
| RIL APEX builds/signs | `m com.google.cf.rild` | pass (incl. `apex_sepolicy_tests`) |
| SIM seed prebuilts resolve | `m iccprofile_for_sim0.xml numeric_operator.xml …` | pass |
| Vendor policy compiles | `m vendor_sepolicy.cil` | pass (control-plane socket rules included) |
| Platform neverallows (vsock, core/vendor sockets) | `m sepolicy_neverallows` | pass |
| Product/board wiring | `get_build_var PRODUCT_PACKAGES`, `…_COPY_FILES`, `BOARD_BOOTCONFIG`, `TARGET_VENDOR_PROP` | pass |
| **Full user build + OTA package** | `m otapackage` | pass (`lineage_virtio_x86_64-ota.zip`, signed, `unzip -t` clean) |
| **UTM VM bundle (x86_64)** | `m vm-utm-zip` | pass (`UTM-VM-lineage-23.2-…-virtio_x86_64.zip`, 4 files in the `.utm` bundle) |
| **UTM VM bundle (arm64)** | `m vm-utm-zip` on `virtio_arm64only` | pass (`UTM-VM-…-virtio_arm64only.zip` → `LineageOS_on_arm64.utm`, `Architecture=aarch64`, ESP is `BOOTAA64.EFI` + `arm64-efi` GRUB only) |
| **Arm64 build with the control plane** | `m vm-utm-zip otapackage` on `virtio_arm64only` | pass (`UTM-VM-lineage-23.2-20260924-…`, 1139 MB; OTA 1032 MB, `unzip -t` clean) |

The arm64 build dated **20260924** is the one that carries `modem_console`; the
`modem_console` row in the image table below was re-checked against it. The
patched simulator *sources* that `apply.sh` generates (upstream plus the
`patch_modem_simulator.py` changes) are shipped under `sim/reference/` in the
source archive, so the exact code that got compiled is auditable even without
re-running the patcher.
| Raw dynamic-partition disk the UTM bundles boot | `diskimage-vda` | pass (`disk-vda.img`, `super.img`), both products |

The two products are independent and each has its own `vm_templates/utm/config.plist`
(`virtio_x86_64` → `x86_64`/`q35`, `virtio_arm64only` → `aarch64`/`virt`). Both
inherit `device/virt/virtio-common` — where this overlay hooks in — so the SIM
config applies to both without duplication:

```
virtio_arm64only → virtio_arm64 → virtio-common   (overlay + hooks)
virtio_x86_64    →                virtio-common
```

Checked inside the produced images (not just the staging dirs) — the same six
entries below hold for **both** `virtio_x86_64` and `virtio_arm64only`, verified
per product by unpacking the generated `super.img`:

| In the image | Where |
|---|---|
| `modem_simulator_virtio` (373 KB) | `vendor.img:/bin/hw/` |
| `modem_console` (151 KB) | `system.img:/bin/` |
| `init.virtio.sim.rc` | `vendor.img:/etc/init/hw/` |
| SIM profile + operator DB | `vendor.img:/etc/modem_simulator/files/{iccprofile_for_sim0.xml, iccprofile_for_sim0_for_CtsCarrierApiTestCases.xml, numeric_operator.xml}` |
| `ro.radio.noril=0`, `ro.telephony.default_network=33` | `vendor.img:/build.prop` |
| `modem_simulator`, `modem_simulator_exec`, `modem_simulator_data_file`, `libcuttlefish_rild*` | `vendor.img:/etc/selinux/vendor_sepolicy.cil` |
| `com.google.cf.rild.apex` | `vendor.img:/apex/` |
| all of the above | the **bootable** disk: `super.img` → `lpunpack -p vendor` → `vendor.img` (i.e. `diskvda`'s `super` partition) |

### What the host tests actually prove

`sim/run-host-tests.sh` is not a self-consistency round-trip: it compiles the
console's codec against the **real** `PDUParser` from the Cuttlefish simulator
(patched exactly as `apply.sh` patches it), so every PDU the console builds is
validated by the code that will validate it in the guest - including the strict
length arithmetic that catches septet-packing and UDH-padding mistakes. It also
decodes AOSP's own test vectors (whence the byte-exact expectation
`//CTSVVM:SYNC:key=value`), and guards the harness by asserting that a known-bad
PDU is still rejected.

| Group | Covers |
|---|---|
| Generated PDUs accepted by the simulator parser | plain 7-bit, escape table, UCS2 (incl. emoji), multipart with 8- and 16-bit references, binary WAP push with ports, alphanumeric sender, class 0 with an explicit time stamp, no-SMSC |
| Decode round-trips | text, SMSC, sender, DCS, UDH, concatenation, ports, time stamp |
| AOSP vectors | `0001000D9168…` → `//CTSVVM:SYNC:key=value` on `8618810189440`; `00010004814554…` → `你` on `5445` |
| Limits | 160 septets fits, 161 refused, 140-octet payload ceiling |
| Negative control | the corrupt PDU AOSP expects to fail is still rejected |

Still unverified: actually **booting** the image and confirming the framework
reports the SIM, that injected SMS appear in the Messaging app, and that the
control-plane socket is reachable from `adb shell` (expect the first boot to need
SELinux denial triage: `modem_simulator` is a brand-new domain and the console is
a coredomain client).

## Build environment gotchas

Four host issues made this look like a SIM problem when it was not. Run
`sim/host-quirks.sh --fix` to check all of them (and to apply the third one,
which is a repair inside the synced tree); otherwise check them by hand first:

1. **GNU coreutils, not uutils.** Ubuntu 26.04 ships `uutils` `expr`, whose
   `expr 25 == 25` is a *syntax error*. LineageOS gates
   `BOARD_MESA3D_MESON_ARGS` on `$(shell expr $(MESA_VERSION_MAJOR) \== 25)`, so on
   uutils that variable silently ends up **empty** and Mesa then tries to build
   `libclc` and fails with `Dependency "libclc" not found`. Fix:
   `apt install coreutils-from-gnu` (or point `/usr/bin/expr` at `/usr/bin/gnuexpr`).
   Check with `get_build_var BOARD_MESA3D_MESON_ARGS` — it must contain
   `-Dmesa-clc=system`.
2. **`pkg-config`, `ninja` and Python Mako must be installed.** Mesa's meson
   setup needs them;
   the failures read `Pkg-config for machine host machine not found` and
   `Could not detect Ninja v1.8.2 or newer`, or
   `Python (3.x) mako module >= 0.8.0 required to build mesa`.
   Install `pkg-config ninja-build python3-mako` on Ubuntu. The preflight checks
   these before compilation.
3. **`prebuilts/bootmgr`'s bundled glibc is broken on modern hosts.**
   `build/tasks/10-bootmgr-defs.mk` runs the prebuilt mtools/xorriso/grub tools
   through the *bundled* loader
   (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=prebuilts/bootmgr/lib64 prebuilts/bootmgr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`),
   and `30-create_images.mk` then runs `mformat -F -i <img> -v <label> ::`, which
   converts the volume label through codepage 850. That bundled glibc cannot do
   the conversion and the build dies generating the FAT boot images:

   ```
   mformat: Error converting to codepage 850 Invalid argument
   ```

   Verified by replaying the shipped library from git against the repaired one:
   original → exit 1 with that error, system glibc → exit 0. Repair (what
   `host-quirks.sh --fix` does):

   ```shell
   ln -sfn /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 prebuilts/bootmgr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
   ln -sfn /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6          prebuilts/bootmgr/lib64/libc.so.6
   ```

   The other bundled libs (`libz`, `liblzma`, `libpthread`) are still used via
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This is a change inside a `repo`-managed prebuilt project,
   so `repo status` will show it as a modification of `prebuilts/bootmgr`.
4. **OTA packaging hangs on a QEMU guest.** The ramdisk ships
   `ROOT/d -> /sys/kernel/debug`; Info-ZIP `zip` (used by
   `ota_from_target_files`) follows symlinks and walks `/sys/kernel/debug` on the
   *host*. On a QEMU VM whose USB tablet registers a HID debug node, `zip` blocks
   forever reading `/sys/kernel/debug/hid/*/events`. Work around it by packaging
   in a private mount namespace with debugfs hidden:

   ```shell
   unshare -m --propagation private bash -c \
     'umount /sys/kernel/debug; source build/envsetup.sh; lunch lineage_virtio_x86_64-user; m otapackage'
   ```

   (Only the OTA/target-files zips are affected — the images, and `vm-utm-zip`,
   are produced before it.)

## Notes / limitations

* Injected SMS appear in whatever app handles them, but the *device's* own SMS
  database is the framework's: the console can make the network deliver a
  message and can observe what the user sends, it cannot write into `mmssms.db`.
  A message the user sends to a real-looking number is reported to `sms watch`
  rather than actually leaving the device (there is no network to leave).
* `modem_console` only works while `modem_simulator_virtio` is running; it reconnects
  per invocation, so a dead simulator gives `cannot reach the modem simulator`.
* Data call addresses/gateway/DNS are supplied by the simulator
  (`cf_device_config_virtio.cpp`). The emulated PDP context is reported as
  connected, but it is not bridged to the VM's real NIC, so cellular data does
  not route to the internet. Bridge it to `eth0` if you need real throughput.
* The vsock loopback rewrite is a one-line substitution against the pinned
  Cuttlefish source; if upstream changes that call site, update `apply.sh`.
* This overlay is applied at build time and is not a fork of the device tree:
  delete `sim/` (or skip `apply.sh`) to build plain LineageOS again.
